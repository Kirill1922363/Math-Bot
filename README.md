I made a Telegram bot that helps in learning algebra and geometry. It is designed to quickly calculate examples, check results and support the user during learning.
Algebra:
Simple arithmetic operations
Raising to a power
Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tg)
Geometry:
Areas of a circle, rectangle and triangle
Length of a circle, perimeter of a rectangle
